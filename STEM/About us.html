			<p>STEM is a digital news article Company. We focus on delivering news about the digital technology industry, and transform emerging ideas into viable products that move the digital industry forward. Our writers research key areas to uncover new ways to help communities do different things and do things differently.</p>
			<h1>Human evolution</h1>
			<p>Many people fear transhumanism. Critics warn of designer babies and chips implanted in our minds. Theologians fear we will denigrate the soul’s sanctity by achieving immortality. In the early 2000s, the editors of Foreign Policy asked policy intellectuals: “What idea, if embraced, would pose the greatest threat to the welfare of humanity?” Francis Fukuyama, professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, pointed to transhumanism, calling it the “world’s most dangerous idea.”</p>
			<h1>Our purpose</h1>
			<p>STEM is dedicated to keeping everyone with enough knowledge to live everyday knowing what's going on in our world. By keeping everyone up-to-date with our world's most important happenings, we all grow as individuals, and with human being getting closer to evolution, it's essential to to know a bit about everything related to science and technology.</p>

					<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
					<p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed where to look. The result? High-value predictions that can guide better decisions and smart actions in real time without human intervention.</p>
					<p>Deep learning combines advances in computing power and special types of neural networks to learn complicated patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning techniques are currently state- of-the-art for identifying objects in images and words in sounds.</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Google's first ever tweet in twitter was in February 2009, and reads <br> "I'm 01100110 01100101 01100101 01101100 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01110101 01100011 01101011 01111001 00001010" Translating from binary to english, this tweet says "I'm feeling lucky."</p>
